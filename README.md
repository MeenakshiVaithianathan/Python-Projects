# Python-Project -  Exploring Credit Risk Analysis 

Diving into Python scripts is both challenging and rewarding. Here's my attempt at leveraging Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, and Pandas on a toy dataset for credit risk analysis.

**Project Overview:** Credit risk analysis is crucial for banking, financial, and insurance industries. For this experiment, I used a dataset containing credit applicant profiles. 

**Key Steps:**
-	Data Cleaning & EDA: To understand the existing patterns & identified data imbalances.
-	Visualization Exploration: Experimented with Matplotlib and Seaborn, two of the most popular visualization libraries in Python.
-	Defining KPIs & Metrics: To visualize them using bar, column, clustered, area & line, violin, scatter plots etc.
-	Model Development: Built a random forest model to predict credit risk status, showcasing the power of machine learning in financial analysis.

**Derived Insights:**
- **Demographic Distribution:** The bank has a client base with 70% male and 30% female clients, with 73% of account holders aged 20-40. This indicates a potential demographic bias towards younger males.
- **Employment and Homeownership:** 63% of clients are skilled professionals, and two-thirds are homeowners with minimal savings and moderate checking account balances.
- **Loan Characteristics:** 75% of accounts hold less than $5,000 in credit loans for 0-2 years. The primary loan purposes are purchasing cars and home appliances, followed by furniture and equipment.
- **Credit Risk:** 36% of the credit amounts are at risk, with an average loan duration of 24.9 months. Skilled professionals and homeowners are more prone to risk, with the most defaulted loans previously used for vacations, business ventures, and car purchases.

**Recommendations for Improving the Credit Approval Process:**
1. **Diversify Client Base:** Implement targeted marketing strategies to attract a more balanced demographic, including older clients and more female clients.
2. **Enhance Risk Assessment:** Develop more stringent risk assessment criteria, especially for skilled professionals and homeowners seeking loans for high-risk purposes as mentioned above.
4. **Loan Purpose Monitoring:** Closely monitor loan purposes and implement stricter approval criteria for loans intended for high-risk purposes identified in the analysis.
5. **Review and Adjust Credit Limits:** Regularly review and adjust credit limits based on the clientâ€™s financial behavior and repayment history to minimize risk exposure.
6. **Increase Savings and Checking Incentives:** Encourage clients to maintain higher savings and checking account balances through incentivized programs, which can act as a buffer against default.

These recommendations aim to balance the client base, enhance risk assessment, and promote financial stability among clients, thereby improving the overall credit approval process.

This project was a great learning experience, pushing me to expand my skill set beyond traditional BI tools. Excited to apply these new insights in future projects!
